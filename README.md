# School_District_Analysis

## Overview of the school district analysis
The purpose of this analysis was to see how the cheating students of Thomas High School effected the overall analysis made by the school board.

## Results
- The percentage of overall student passing in Thomas High school went down without the 9th graders, as well as the percentage of students who passed reading and math.
- With concern to school size, the data didn't change any of the data values that we were looking at.
- With concern to school type, the data didn't change any of the data values that we were looking at.
- With concern to spending per student, the data didnt change in any signficant way.
- Overall, the only values that change were specific to Thomas High School and dint skew the data as the school board thought.

## Summary
The four changes that I see within the updated school anaylsis with respect to the reading and writing scores that were nullifed were that the Thomas reading number was changed by .1%, the math numbers for Thomas also went up by .3%, the overall percentage of Thomas students passing both went down by .3% and the averages for both reading stayed relative the same with the math score only increasing by .1%. Overall, the data was not effected too much by the 461 students who were nullifed from the list due to cheating.
